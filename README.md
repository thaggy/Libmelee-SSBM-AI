##Project Goal
The goal of this project is NOT actually to create the ultimate AI to take over the melee scene. That would, if anything, be a side effect of this project. The goal of this project is to not create tools for other developers to use in their respective smashbots. I am creating basic tools for other developers to use and even modify when they create their renditions of the smashbot. My Smash Bot is just an example of what can be done, not nessecarily the final product.
